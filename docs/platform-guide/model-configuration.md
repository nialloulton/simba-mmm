# Model Configuration — Deep Reference Guide

This guide provides a detailed reference for every configuration feature in Simba's model building workflow. For the step-by-step wizard overview, see the [Model Creation Wizard](./model-creation-wizard.md). For how [smart defaults](./smart-defaults.md) are calculated, see the Smart Defaults guide.

The configuration workflow uses a five-step wizard (Source → Model Setup → Variable Selection → Prior Builder → Model Details) to build [Bayesian](../core-concepts/bayesian-modeling.md) Marketing Mix Models or [VAR](../core-concepts/var-modeling.md) models. This page dives deep into each configuration feature.

## Managing Models

### Available Models

After building a model, it appears in the **Available Models** tab with real-time status tracking.

![Available Models list](./images/mc-model-list.png)

| # | Element | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Available Models header** | List icon with title and subtitle. Shows all fitted models in the current project. |
| 2 | **Status indicators** | COMPLETE (green check), UNDER_WAY (orange spinner), PENDING (gray clock with queue position), FAILED (red alert triangle) |
| 3 | **Progress bar** | Real-time progress for models currently fitting. Shows percentage complete. |
| 4 | **Action buttons** | Eye (view results, requires COMPLETE), BookmarkCheck (save to project), Trash2 (delete), PauseCircle (cancel running model) |
| 5 | **Batch model badge** | Indigo badge with Layers icon indicates models built from a hierarchy/panel data configuration |

#### Model statuses

| Status | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **PENDING** | Clock (gray) | Queued for fitting. Shows position in queue and estimated wait. |
| **UNDER_WAY** | Loader (orange, spinning) | Currently fitting. Progress bar updates in real-time. |
| **COMPLETE** | Check (green) | Successfully fitted. View, save, and delete actions available. |
| **FAILED** | AlertTriangle (red) | Fitting failed. Click for error details. Delete available. |
| **TIME_EXCEEDED** | Clock (orange) | Fitting exceeded the time limit. Treated like a failure. |
| **REVOKED** | PauseCircle (blue) | User cancelled the fitting process. |
| **REVOKE_IN_PROGRESS** | MoreHorizontal (blue) | Cancellation in progress. |

### Saved Models & Projects

The **Saved Models** tab organizes completed models into projects. Two views are available:

- **My Models** — All models you own, whether shared or not
- **Shared Models** — Models shared with you by other users, or models you've shared out

Models can be moved between projects, duplicated, and connected (e.g., linking an MMM to a VAR model for [long-term effects](./long-term-effects.md) analysis).

## Prior Builder — Custom Mode Deep Dive

The Prior Builder is where you configure [prior distributions](../core-concepts/priors-and-distributions.md) that encode your beliefs about each channel's effect. Two modes are available: **Standard** (AI-driven, see [Smart Defaults](./smart-defaults.md)) and **Custom** (full manual control).

### AG Grid Configuration

Custom mode provides an interactive AG Grid table with single-click cell editing. Every parameter is directly editable.

![Custom AG Grid prior table](./images/mc-ag-grid.png)

The inline legend below the table explains the color coding:
- **Blue (#eff6ff)** — Distribution column
- **Purple (#faf5ff)** — Transform column
- **Yellow (#fef9c3)** — [Saturation](../core-concepts/saturation-curves.md) point
- **Light blue (#dbeafe)** — [Decay](../core-concepts/adstock-effects.md) parameters and α_sd
- **Green (#f0fdf4)** — Adstock type and theta parameters
- **Sparkles (purple)** — [Halo](../core-concepts/halo-effects.md) channel indicator
- **Award (orange)** — Trademark/portfolio channel indicator

#### Media variable columns

| Column | Width | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Variable** | 200px | Channel name with halo/trademark badges. Pinned left. |
| **Distribution** | 140px | Prior distribution: `inversegamma` (default for media), `normal`, `truncatednormal`, or `tvp` |
| **Mean (μ)** | 100px | Expected coefficient value. Range: -5 to 5 |
| **Sigma (σ)** | 100px | Uncertainty (standard deviation). Default: 2× mean |
| **Transform** | 100px | Data transformation: `N` (None, for media), `DM` (Divide by Mean, for controls), `STA`, `DDM` |
| **Saturation** | 130px | Activity level where channel reaches 50% of maximum effect. Auto-populated with average non-zero activity. |
| **α_sd** | 100px | Shape uncertainty of the saturation curve. Alpha mean is fixed at 1.7; only α_sd is editable. Range: 0.1-5.0 |
| **Period** | 90px | Number of time periods the media effect persists. Default: 6 (weekly), 45 (daily). Range: 1-20 |
| **Decay L / U** | 100px each | Lower and upper adstock decay rate bounds. Range: 0.01-0.99 |
| **Adstock** | 120px | Type: `geometric` (instant peak, exponential decay) or `delayed` (peak at theta lag) |
| **θ Mean / SD** | 90px / 80px | For delayed adstock only: expected peak delay and uncertainty (Gamma prior). Disabled for geometric. |
| **Lower / Upper** | 90px each | Bounds for TruncatedNormal and TVP distributions. Media enforces Lower ≥ 0. |
| **Actions** | 80px | Copy (bulk update) and LineChart (graph preview) buttons |

Control variables share Distribution, Mean, Sigma, Transform, Lower/Upper, and Actions columns but omit all saturation, decay, and adstock columns. Control bounds can be negative.

### Lift Test Calibration

Enable lift test calibration to integrate experimental results as **likelihood observations** (not priors) that constrain the model's [saturation](../core-concepts/saturation-curves.md) parameters with direct evidence of [diminishing returns](../core-concepts/incrementality.md).

## Export, Import & Warm Start

### Download / Upload Config

The Model Details step includes export/import buttons:

- **Download Config** (Download icon) — Exports the complete model configuration as a JSON file, including all priors, variable assignments, and settings
- **Upload Config** (Upload icon) — Imports a previously saved configuration file, restoring all settings

This enables reproducible model building and configuration sharing between team members.

### Import from Saved Model

The **Import from Saved Model** dialog enables warm-starting a new model from a previously completed one.

![Import from Saved Model](./images/mc-import-dialog.png)

| # | Element | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Dialog header** | "Import from Saved Model" with explanation that posteriors become new priors |
| 2 | **Selected model** | Blue highlight card showing the model being imported from |
| 3 | **Import options** | Three checkboxes: **Variable Selections** (Date, KPI, Media, Costs, Controls, Linked Items, Halo & Trademark), **Priors** (N posteriors → priors, with adjusted scalars), **Model Settings** (Trend, Seasonality, TVP, Sampling, Train/Test split) |
| 4 | **Import Selected** | Applies checked selections. If priors are imported, the Prior Builder automatically switches to Custom mode. |

**When to use warm start:**
- Iterating on a model with refined priors from posterior results
- Applying a proven configuration to new data (e.g., next quarter's data)
- Sharing configurations across brands in a portfolio

## Model Features (Custom Mode)

When in Custom build mode, the Model Details step shows a right column with toggleable features:

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Include Dynamic Baseline** | Off | Adds smooth local linear trend (HSGP Matern52) to capture underlying trends |
| **Include Automatic Seasonality** | Off | Adds Fourier-based seasonal components |
| **Time-Varying Media Variables** | Off | Allows channel effects to change over time (TVP distribution) |
| **Include Special Events** | Off | Enables holiday/event selection with country-specific calendars |

When **Include Special Events** is enabled, the panel expands to show periodicity detection, week convention, holiday country selector, and manual date picker.
