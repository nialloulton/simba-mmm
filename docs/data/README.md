## Guides

### [Data Requirements](./data-requirements.md)
What data you need, supported formats (CSV only, 50MB max), date formats, and minimum requirements. Covers the six variable types: date, target KPI, media, cost, multiplier, and hierarchy --- with Simba's semantic matcher auto-detecting columns from their names.

### [Data Preparation](./data-preparation.md)
Best practices for cleaning and formatting. Covers time alignment, missing value handling (zeros for no-spend, resolve all NaN before fitting), negative value rules, and the Data Validator's 10 automated checks.

### [Data Validation](./data-validation.md)
How Simba's Data Validator assesses your data across 10 categories: schema, frequency, alignment, multiplier, controls, coverage, outliers, multicollinearity, leakage, and documentation. Triggered via the **Start Validator Agent** button.

### [Supported Channels](./supported-channels.md)
The 15 channel categories Simba auto-detects (TV, digital, social, search, video, radio, print, OOH, email, influencer, affiliate, direct mail, mobile, cinema, sponsorship), the 4 metric types (Spend, Impressions, GRPs, Clicks), and typical saturation/decay profiles by channel type.

- [ ] A **hierarchy column** (brand name, or a single repeated value for single-brand models)
- [ ] **Media + cost variable pairs** for each channel (e.g., `tv_impressions` + `tv_spend`)
