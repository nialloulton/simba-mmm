# Simba Documentation

**The complete guide to Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling with Simba** --- from first upload to optimized budget recommendations.

Simba is a no-code MMM platform built on [PyMC-Marketing](https://www.pymc-marketing.io/). Every model is fully transparent, every prior is configurable, and every result includes calibrated uncertainty intervals.

## Core Concepts

The statistical and marketing foundations behind every Simba model. Read these to understand *why* the platform works the way it does.

| Concept | What you'll learn |
|---|---|
| [Marketing Mix Modeling](./core-concepts/marketing-mix-modeling.md) | What MMM is, how it differs from MTA, and why Bayesian MMM is the standard |
| [Bayesian Modeling](./core-concepts/bayesian-modeling.md) | Priors + likelihood = posterior; uncertainty quantification; 94% HDI |
| [Incrementality](./core-concepts/incrementality.md) | Causal attribution, base vs. incremental revenue, lift test calibration |
| [Saturation Curves](./core-concepts/saturation-curves.md) | Diminishing returns via `tanh` saturation with scalar and alpha parameters |
| [Adstock Effects](./core-concepts/adstock-effects.md) | Carryover and decay --- geometric and delayed adstock (always applied before saturation) |
| [Priors & Distributions](./core-concepts/priors-and-distributions.md) | Normal, InverseGamma, TruncatedNormal, TVP --- configuring what the model believes before seeing data |
| [Seasonality](./core-concepts/seasonality.md) | Fourier seasonality, HSGP trend, GP-smoothed events --- all opt-in |
| [Budget Optimization](./core-concepts/budget-optimization.md) | Marginal equalization, mean-variance optimization, gamma risk aversion, posterior-aware allocation |
| [Halo Effects](./core-concepts/halo-effects.md) | Cross-brand lift: halo channels (fixed 0.005 coefficient) and trademark channels (75% prior reduction) |
| [VAR Modeling](./core-concepts/var-modeling.md) | Bayesian VAR with Minnesota priors --- impulse response, FEVD, and long-run multipliers |

## How Simba Works

```
 CSV Upload ──→ Data Validator ──→ Model Configuration ──→ Bayesian Fitting
                 (10 checks)       (priors, adstock,        (PyMC-Marketing)
                                    saturation, trend)
                                                                  │
                ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                ▼
         Active Model ──→ Budget Optimization ──→ Scenario Planning
         (contributions,    (risk-adjusted,         (what-if forecasts,
          response curves,   per-channel bounds,     uncertainty bands,
          ROAS, 94% HDI)     portfolio-level)        carryover-aware)
```

**Every output includes uncertainty.** Simba uses the full posterior distribution (~3,000 samples) for optimization and forecasting --- not point estimates.
