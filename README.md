**Simba is a no-code Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling platform that measures media effectiveness, optimizes budgets, and forecasts marketing ROI.** Replace spreadsheets, fragmented models, and black-box vendors with one transparent, enterprise-ready platform.

Built on the open-source [PyMC-Marketing](https://www.pymc-marketing.io/) framework by [PyMC Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.com/), Simba combines the rigor of Bayesian statistics with an intuitive no-code interface — giving marketing teams enterprise-grade marketing mix modeling without writing a single line of code.

## What is Marketing Mix Modeling?

Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique that measures the impact of marketing activities on business outcomes like revenue and conversions. Unlike last-click attribution or multi-touch attribution (MTA), MMM uses aggregate data to isolate the **incremental contribution** of each media channel — accounting for diminishing returns, carryover effects, seasonality, and external factors.

Simba makes MMM accessible to marketing teams who need rigorous measurement without hiring a data science team. See [What is Marketing Mix Modeling?](docs/core-concepts/marketing-mix-modeling.md) for a full explanation.

## Why Choose Simba for Marketing Mix Modeling?

| Challenge | How Simba Solves It |
|---|---|
| Black-box MMM vendors deliver "trust me" results | Fully transparent — inspect every prior, parameter, and assumption |
| Custom MMM models take months to build and maintain | No-code model configuration with smart defaults — first model in 15 minutes |
| Fragmented tools for measurement, planning, and optimization | End-to-end platform: validate data, measure impact, forecast scenarios, optimize budgets |
| One-size-fits-all models ignore domain expertise | Bayesian priors let you encode business knowledge directly into the model |
| Siloed models across brands and markets | Portfolio modeling for cross-brand and cross-market consistency |

## Key Features

### Media Measurement & Attribution
Measure the true incremental impact of every marketing channel using Bayesian causal attribution. Integrate lift test results as likelihood observations to calibrate and validate your model. See [Incremental Measurement](docs/platform-guide/measurement.md).

### Budget Optimization
Risk-adjusted budget allocation that accounts for saturation (diminishing returns), adstock (carryover effects), and uncertainty. Optimize across channels with configurable risk tolerance. See [Budget Optimization](docs/platform-guide/budget-optimization.md).

### Scenario Planning & Forecasting
Test budget scenarios before spending. Single-scenario prediction with uncertainty bands, what-if analysis, and carryover-aware forecasting. See [Scenario Planning](docs/platform-guide/scenario-planning.md).

### No-Code Model Configuration
Configure Bayesian priors, saturation curves, and adstock decay through an intuitive UI. Smart defaults auto-generate starting points based on your data and industry benchmarks. See [Model Configuration](docs/platform-guide/model-configuration.md).

### Automated Data Validation
An AI-powered Data Validator checks your data across 10 validation categories before modeling — detecting anomalies, missing values, multicollinearity, and data quality issues. See [Data Validator](docs/platform-guide/data-auditor.md).

### Portfolio & Multi-Brand Modeling
Cross-brand and cross-client modeling for agencies and multi-brand organizations. Consistent methodology, comparable KPIs, centralized management. See [Portfolio Modeling](docs/use-cases/portfolio-modeling.md).

### Long-Term Effects (Bayesian VAR)
Measure long-term brand effects using Bayesian Vector Autoregression — impulse response functions, forecast error variance decomposition, and long-run equilibrium effects. See [Long-Term Effects](docs/platform-guide/long-term-effects.md).

## How Simba Works

Simba provides a complete workflow for marketing mix modeling:

**1. Validate** — The [Data Validator](docs/platform-guide/data-auditor.md) automatically audits your data for quality issues before modeling.

**2. Configure** — Set up your model using [no-code configuration](docs/platform-guide/model-configuration.md) with [smart defaults](docs/platform-guide/smart-defaults.md) or custom Bayesian priors.

**3. Measure** — Run the model and get [incremental measurement](docs/platform-guide/measurement.md) of every channel's contribution to revenue.

**4. Optimize** — Use [budget optimization](docs/platform-guide/budget-optimization.md) and [scenario planning](docs/platform-guide/scenario-planning.md) to allocate spend for maximum ROI.

## The Bayesian Advantage

Simba uses Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling rather than frequentist regression. This matters because:

- **Uncertainty quantification** — every estimate comes with a 94% HDI (Highest Density Interval), so you know how confident to be in each channel's ROI
- **Prior knowledge** — encode domain expertise (e.g., "TV has longer carryover than paid search") directly into the model
- **Lift test calibration** — integrate experimental results (lift tests, geo tests) as likelihood observations to validate and improve model accuracy
- **Small data friendly** — Bayesian models produce reliable estimates even with limited historical data
- **Fully transparent** — built on open-source [PyMC-Marketing](https://www.pymc-marketing.io/), so every model component is inspectable and auditable
