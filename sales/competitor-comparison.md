# Competitor Comparison — How Simba Compares to Other MMM Solutions

## The MMM Landscape

The marketing mix modeling space includes open-source libraries, SaaS platforms, and custom consulting engagements. Here's how Simba compares across the most common alternatives.

## Simba vs. Open-Source Libraries

### Meta's Robyn

Robyn is an open-source MMM package from Meta, built in R.

| Dimension | Robyn | Simba |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Approach** | Ridge regression + gradient-based optimization | Full Bayesian inference (PyMC) |
| **Uncertainty** | Limited (multi-objective optimization produces multiple solutions) | Full posterior distributions with credible intervals |
| **Coding required** | Yes (R) | No (UI-based configuration) |
| **Prior configuration** | Limited | Full Bayesian prior configuration per channel |
| **Data validation** | Manual | AI-powered Data Validator |
| **Scenario planning** | Basic (manual post-processing) | Built-in with uncertainty bands |
| **Optimization** | Built-in but deterministic | Risk-adjusted with carryover awareness |
| **Support** | Community only | Dedicated support + Managed tier |
| **Maintenance** | Self-maintained | Fully managed platform |

**Key difference**: Robyn requires R coding expertise and uses ridge regression rather than full Bayesian inference. Simba provides a complete platform experience with no-code configuration and full uncertainty quantification.

### Google's LightweightMMM / Meridian

Google's open-source MMM offerings for Python.

| Dimension | LightweightMMM/Meridian | Simba |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| **Approach** | Bayesian (JAX/NumPyro) | Bayesian (PyMC) |
| **Coding required** | Yes (Python) | No (UI-based) |
| **Data validation** | Manual | AI-powered Data Validator |
| **Scenario planning** | Manual post-processing | Built-in platform feature |
| **Optimization** | Manual implementation | Built-in, risk-adjusted |
| **UI** | None (notebook-based) | Full web application |
| **Multi-model management** | Manual | Built-in model management |
| **Portfolio modeling** | Not supported | Cross-brand portfolios |
| **Support** | Community only | Dedicated support |

**Key difference**: Google's tools are Python libraries, not platforms. They require significant data science expertise to implement, maintain, and scale. Simba provides the same Bayesian rigor in a managed platform.

### Custom R/Python Models

Some organizations build MMM models from scratch using statsmodels, PyMC, Stan, or custom R code.

| Dimension | Custom Models | Simba |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Flexibility** | Maximum | High (configurable within Bayesian framework) |
| **Time to first model** | Weeks to months | Hours |
| **Maintenance burden** | High (ongoing development) | None (managed platform) |
| **Consistency** | Varies by analyst | Standardized methodology |
| **Scalability** | Manual replication | Multi-model, multi-brand built-in |
| **Data validation** | Custom implementation | AI-powered, built-in |
| **Scenario planning** | Custom implementation | Built-in |

**Key difference**: Custom models offer maximum flexibility but require significant ongoing investment in development, maintenance, and quality assurance. Simba provides 90% of the flexibility at 10% of the effort.

## Simba vs. SaaS MMM Platforms

### General SaaS MMM Comparison

| Dimension | Typical SaaS MMM | Simba |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Transparency** | Black-box (proprietary models) | Fully transparent (open-source PyMC foundation) |
| **Methodology** | Often proprietary or undisclosed | Bayesian, open-source, peer-reviewed |
| **Auditability** | Limited — "trust our numbers" | Full — inspect every prior and parameter |
| **Foundation** | Proprietary code | Open-source PyMC-Marketing |
| **Vendor lock-in** | High | Low (open-source methodology) |
| **Data validation** | Basic or manual | AI-powered Data Validator |

## Simba vs. Consulting/Agency Models

| Dimension | Consulting MMM | Simba |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Cost** | $100K–$500K+ per study | Subscription-based (fraction of the cost) |
| **Turnaround** | 3–6 months | Hours to days |
| **Frequency** | Quarterly or annual | Continuous |
| **Self-service** | No (consultant-dependent) | Yes (with Managed tier available) |
| **Scalability** | Linear cost increase | Fixed subscription |
| **Methodology ownership** | Consultant owns it | You own the logic (open-source foundation) |

## Summary: When to Choose Simba

Choose Simba when you need:

- **Transparency and auditability** — your stakeholders need to trust and understand the methodology
- **Speed** — you can't wait months for an econometric study
- **Scale** — you need to model multiple brands, markets, or clients
- **No-code access** — your team doesn't have dedicated data scientists for MMM
- **Continuous measurement** — you want ongoing optimization, not periodic studies
- **Bayesian rigor** — you want uncertainty quantification, not point estimates
